"""Claim gate v2.6: counting-closure claims must carry command evidence nearby.

The write-path discipline (runbook §五 rule 1: 数字先跑后写) in mechanical
form. Historical incidents this gate family exists for (all real, all in
this campaign): 56号「17 个新提交」(actual 18), 「12 测试全绿」(actual 11),
61号 command missing `^` (number right, command rebuilt from memory), 64号
「11 处+1 删除」(actual 151 deletions) — every one a count written from
memory with no command run at write time.

Current execution scope (v2.6): only constrained wc/grep commands may be
replayed. All git commands are reported as SKIPPED-UNSAFE
(git-replay-disabled), never executed. Historical version notes below
describe older behavior, not the current execution surface.

Usage:
    python3 tools/claim_gate.py FILE...           # list violations, rc=1 if any
    python3 tools/claim_gate.py --check FILE...   # same, quiet (violations only)
    python3 tools/claim_gate.py --rerun FILE...   # tier 1 (v2.0, default OFF):
        for every claim line that DOES carry an evidence command in the ±8
        window, extract the command text, execute it (argv, no shell, read-only
        whitelist, 10 s per command, cwd = the document's own directory) and
        compare against the pasted output block in the document. Failure /
        value drift / no pasted block = RERUN-MISMATCH. Non-whitelisted /
        write-effect / network / shell-metachar forms = SKIPPED-UNSAFE: they
        are NOT executed and are NOT errors. v2.1 adds the OPERAND FENCE: a
        whitelisted command whose file operands are absolute-path / ..-going
        / symlink-escaping the document's own directory is also SKIPPED-UNSAFE
        (outside-docdir) — not executed, not echoed; and the value-drift line
        no longer echoes executed output content (sha256-prefix instead).
        v2.2 closes the F-1 bypass of that fence (inner-audit): a '-'-leading
        flag token carrying a path (-f/PATH, --file=PATH, -f~, -f..) is no
        longer
        skipped — it refuses as SKIPPED-UNSAFE (flag-path-form). The v2.1
        "not executed" sentence was FALSE for those forms as shipped (see the
        annotated M3 entry below).
        RERUN_TIMEOUT=<sec> overrides the per-command timeout. --rerun prints
        the default verdicts first and leaves them byte-identical; rc=1 when
        violations OR mismatches exist. Zero default hits print the v1.8 clean
        line "claim gate: clean (N file(s))" (v2.1); the --rerun summary ends
        with an explicit "executed=K/SKIPPED=J" count so "0 OK + 0 MISMATCH
        because nothing ever ran" is machine-visible without touching rc.

FORM-LIMITED (clause ⑤ family — a text peg, boundaries recorded): the DEFAULT
path scans for counting-closure patterns (恰 N 处 / 共 N / N 个提交 / N 条 PASS /
M=11 D=151 A=10 / 十行 / 十二条 …) and requires an executable-looking command
within the bidirectional ±8-line evidence window. It CANNOT judge whether the
command actually produces the claimed number — that remains the writer's
write-time duty and the reviewer's rerun duty (presence-form only). The v2.0
--rerun tier narrows the second half of that sentence ONLY OPTIONALLY and ONLY
for a whitelisted command shape with a pasted block to compare against: it
verifies COMMAND-vs-PASTE fidelity (is the paste still what the command prints
now), never CLAIM-vs-COMMAND (does the paste equal the number in the prose —
that comparison stays human/reviewer work, pinned by RR07 where a sha paste is
"equal" while the count claim next to it is unrelated by construction).
Non-counting claims (dates, ids, blob prefixes inside tables that carry
commands) are out of scope. False positives are possible; the gate's verdict
is "flag for human look", never "silently trust".

Evasion boundaries below are SINGULARITY-VERIFIED (2026-11-09 attack run;
regression-checked by --selftest — future gate edits must not silently
reopen a CLOSED form):
  CLOSED in v1.2 — bare-tool backtick (`git` in prose is not evidence;
    the backtick form requires whitespace + argument after the tool name),
    spaced triples ("M = 11"), round-label noise (R74 条款 / iter-3 / 1-3 条
    via lookbehind).
  CLOSED in v1.3 (R76 M-1/M-2) — the unbounded-fence window (fence scope is
    plain ±8 everywhere now; the special-case branch is deleted, so the bug
    class is inexpressible); the unit-family escape (10 unit branches —
    项/次/类/组/波/枚/篇/包/个/PASS — 8 with real-doc carriers under GATE
    semantics: 连续 2 次, 24 个 B/M, 3 PASS 4 FAIL; 波/篇 carry zero gate-
    visible lines — 波's only text form 「N3 波」 is lookbehind-blocked,
    篇 has no raw hit; each pinned); ordinal/slash-list noise
    (第 3 项 / 3/7 项 via lookbehind).
  CLOSED in v1.4/v1.5 (R76 iter-1 B-1 + iter-2 M-2/M-3) — the OUTPUT-ROLE
    structure: a "# → …" pasted-output line takes evidence from the
    generating command ANYWHERE in the SAME fence; a "# →" line is skipped
    ONLY when the fence carries a command — otherwise it falls back to the
    ±8 window and flags when no command is in scope either (the忘贴命令
    disease form; v1.3's unconditional # skip silently deleted that red
    face — pinned). The arrow requirement separates output annotations
    from fence-desynced prose headings and far no-arrow # lines (pinned by
    its own case: deleting the arrow condition flips it). (History note:
    v1.2 never flagged pasted outputs — the unbounded fence let far
    commands satisfy them; the "FP family" framing of the v1.3 skip was
    wrong and is retracted.)
  CLOSED in v1.6 (R76 iter-6 M-3) — the bare compound nouns
    (测试/函数/删除/新增/提交/新提交) entered the unit set and the dead
    个X/处差异/条PASS branches retired: the gate's OWN motivating disease
    form 「12 测试全绿」 (56号: claimed 12, actual 11) previously escaped
    because 个测试 required the 个 prefix; now pinned by its own selftest
    case. Pin census is DURABLE: `--census` deletes each live unit and
    reruns --selftest (21/21 pinned at v1.6; two axes since v2.0).
  CLOSED in v1.7/v1.8 (R77 M-1 + iter-1 B-1 honest rewrite) — the .-adjacent
    FP family (section numbers 「### 3.3 新增」 etc., 20 gate-flag carriers (heading form 4 in impl + 3 in proposal),
    v1.7 closed via `.` in the lookbehind class); the chmod-mode analogy
    family 「0600 类比」 — v1.7's `=` extension was a FALSE closure (killed
    only 1/13 gate-visible carriers; the ×14 count was raw-grep, ㉜ family
    violation — iter-1 B-1); v1.8 closes it structurally: a 类 unit followed
    by 比 is code-level skipped (prefix-independent), and `=` is REMOVED
    from the class — the X=N count form 「31=39 条」 is a TRUE catch
    (minor-ledger:1229) that v1.7 had silently let escape (iter-1 M-1)
  CLOSED in v2.0 (build-bit #2, two tiers) —
    (a) the Chinese-numeral blind spot: 一二三四五六七八九十百 (plus 零〇两
        and multi-char runs like 二十一/两百) entered the COUNTING DIGIT SLOT
        only, sharing the unchanged 21-member units group, so census derives
        21/21 exactly as before (P-Ⅰ shared-group rule: a second units group
        would silently un-pin half the census; P-Ⅲ: exemptions were taken on
        the numeral/lookbehind side, NEVER by touching the unit table);
        the 「十二项」 right-shift FP is blocked by the numeral-backchain
        lookbehind (CN-B4 pins it: deleting the backchain flips it), the
        ordinal forms 第三条 / 第 三条 stay blocked by the existing 第 pair,
        初十 stays blocked by the 初 pair; and the date/time forms the
        campaign feared (三十天 / 十一点 / 三个月 / 百分之三十 / 十分困难)
        are safe by CLOSED-SET arithmetic — 天/点/月/日/年/秒/分/格/档 are
        NOT units, so no guard was needed for them at all
        [v2.1 corrected: see M2 — FALSE for the 三个月 half of this list:
        个 IS a unit, so the duration reading rode the unit and a guard WAS
        needed (M2 added it). m-3 (inner-audit) in-place note: kept the
        historical sentence verbatim instead of leaving the correction only
        in the M2 cross-ref, which a v2.0-standalone reader consumed as
        truth. 天/格/档 and the other class-outsides stay genuinely
        unguarded-safe.] (calibration:
        measured over the 85-file corpus snapshot, 1500 gained lines, every
        one CN-bearing, lost=0, key-position diff; zero carriers for the
        word-family suspects 次方/十项全能/一元二次/十分/百分之 — grepped,
        empty; pins CN-A1..CN-C6).
    (b) the command-vs-paste fidelity tier (--rerun): a claim line whose
        ±WINDOW scope carries a CMD-shaped line is now re-checkable against
        reality instead of only against presence. The evidence selection is
        deterministic (top-down FIRST command in the window, RR13 pins it —
        "nearest" or "runnable-first" would flip that case); the execution
        surface is a NEW closed set (5 members) strictly narrower than the
        detection set CMD (go/python3 build and write, curl is the network:
        detectable evidence is NOT executable evidence), each member pinned
        and census-mutable on its own axis; argv-direct exec, never shell,
        per-command timeout, cwd pinned to the document's directory; every
        refuse branch is a SKIP, never an error (fail-safe direction,
        R2 of the collision table). Execution is gated twice BEYOND the
        tool table: count tools must name an operand (bare 「`wc -l`」 reads
        stdin — a mention, not evidence, RR19) and git log must be bounded
        (bare 「git log」 is unbounded output, RR20 — 35号:3 carrier). Both
        gates entered mid-implementation from the whole-dir face and were
        added as matrix-addendum rows, not as silent tightening.
  CLOSED in v2.1 (R78 fix-A, review-loop outer-r1 M1–M4/N4). [v2.3 honest
    amendment, outer-r2 M-1: the original heading read "each with its own
    permanent probe" — FALSE as written: the probes pinned VERDICTS but not
    refusal-reason labels, and the quote state machine's OUTSIDE-quote
    normalization half had zero pins (the whole-function identity mutant of
    _md_unescape stayed all-green; outer-r2 镜二② P4). The sentence that
    holds: every v2.1–v2.3 fix ships with a probe that pins its verdict AND
    its reason label (want_reason + census AXIS3, v2.3), and the ㉝④ law
    (no silent behaviour change, no silent exemption) always held]:
    (M1) the zero-hit clean line: v2.0 deleted v1.8's "claim gate: clean
        (N file(s))" stdout line (rc=0 but nothing to paste — a zero-hit
        claim became unfalsifiable). Restored byte-equal to v1.8 (quiet
        --check still silent, rc untouched); pinned by a CLI-face selftest
        case (deleting the print flips it).
    (M2) the 个+time-noun duration FP: 「过去三个月无逾期」 flagged as count
        claim '三个' because 个 sits INSIDE the unit set while 月 sits outside
        it — the v2.0 header's "三个月 safe by CLOSED-SET arithmetic" claim
        was false (this M2 entry corrected that sentence IN PLACE in the
        v2.0(a) block above; the v2.1 text cited "L97-100", a bare line
        anchor that had ALREADY drifted onto the v1.7/v1.8 entries —
        outer-r2 m-3: this header now names entries, never line numbers,
        and carries no self-line-count, because line numbers are exactly
        the from-memory counts this gate flags). Fixed structurally, not
        by an exemption table: a trailing zero-width guard on the units
        group — (?!(?<=个)[月日年点时分秒]) — a 个-unit directly followed by a
        time noun is not a count. The guard lives OUTSIDE the units capture
        group so the single-trailing-capture invariant (P-Ⅰ) and the shared
        21-member UNITS stay byte-unchanged; UNITS derivation is now the
        last plain capture group (robust to trailing assertions) and census
        anchors locate units position-independently. Discrimination is
        bidirectional (CLAUDE.md rule 2): 「三个月/3个月」 False ∧ 「三个新文件/
        3 个文件/共十二行」 True ∧ 「两个星期」 still True (星期 is NOT in the
        adjudicated 7-char class — recorded, not silently widened).
    (M3) the execution operand fence: whitelisted tools used to run with ANY
        file operand (outer-r1 proved `wc -l /etc/hosts` executing and the
        value-drift line echoing the outside content into stdout). Every
        non-flag argv token must now be relative, ".."-free, and realpath-
        contained in the document's directory; violations = SKIPPED-UNSAFE
        (outside-docdir). [v2.2 truth-in-words, F-1: this entry read "…
        never executed, never echoed" and that was FALSE AS SHIPPED — the
        fence skipped EVERY '-'-leading token, so a path hidden inside a
        flag (-f/PATH, --file=PATH, -f~, -f..) bypassed all three checks and
        DID execute against docdir-external files (inner-audit F-1: a 1-bit
        read oracle, oracle_hit OK vs oracle_miss rc≠0, sha12 confirming).
        The "never executed, never echoed" sentence holds only UNDER the
        v2.2 flag-path rule (below and in CLOSED v2.2): a flag token
        containing / ~ .. refuses as SKIPPED-UNSAFE (flag-path-form) —
        pinned by RR28/RR29, which go red if the rule is deleted.]
        Execution output is
        no longer echoed on drift: sha256-prefix of actual replaces the
        first-line echo (choice among bool/length/hash: bool cannot
        distinguish drifts across reruns, length leaks a size oracle, the
        prefix hash leaks no content yet stays comparable). Residual faces
        after the fence are recorded below (third face).
    (M4) the 68号 unbalanced-quote over-skip (v2.0 face 3): the naive split
        on && || ; | shredded a QUOTED pipe (grep -cE '^\\*\\*(真裁|知悉)'
        → orphan quote fragments → SKIPPED before shlex, 7/7 on 68号, the
        acceptance ④ "0 mismatch" was vacuous). v2.1: quote-state segment
        splitting (quoted |/;/&& stay inside their token) + markdown-escape
        normalization OUTSIDE shell quotes only (backslash+backtick,
        backslash+dquote, backslash+star → bare star/backtick/quote; the
        68号 '\\*\\*' inside single quotes is regex, NOT markdown, and must
        survive verbatim — inside-quote text is untouched). RR18 FLIPS from
        SKIPPED-UNSAFE to OK exactly as face 3's pin demanded ("a
        quote-parsing tokenizer MUST flip this case and re-adjudicate"),
        RR25 re-pins the full 68号 shape end-to-end, RR26 the quoted-`;`
        twin. Detection semantics (CMD) are unchanged; the 「21 行」-style
        quote carriers on the default face stay FLAGGED-for-adjudicate as
        before — v2.3 note (outer-r2 m-4): the phrase "quote-exemption"
        used here was a MISNOMER, there is no code-level exemption path,
        only the recorded adjudication practice (flag, human looks, doc is
        not a fix target).
    (N4) census structure: both axes are now labelled (AXIS1(units) /
        AXIS2(whitelist)); the derived lists are checked against frozen
        expectations (21 units / 5 members) FIRST, so deleting a member can
        no longer shrink the iterated axis into a false "ALL 4 pinned" green
        — a removal is named in the FAIL line, and both axes print FLAT
        string lists (missing=['PASS'] / missing=['wc -l'] — the tuple
        form ('wc','-l') this entry used to promise was never emitted,
        outer-r2 m-2 corrected) instead of being mis-attributed to a
        neighbouring anchor (the v2.0 last-branch special case made the PASS
        deletion blame 提交). v2.3: a THIRD axis, AXIS3(reasons), inherits
        this exact structure (derived from the source by _derive_reasons,
        diffed against the frozen _EXPECTED_REASONS both ways, missing
        printed flat and named AXIS3 — the member list itself is the
        register the singularity section asked for). Unit anchors are
        located by a unit-boundary regex, the
        first/last special cases are retired — and the locator semantics make
        a caution law: prose quoting a live anchor token would poison the
        first-occurrence search (caught by the site check below, not by
        silence).
    (rc) rc semantics are UNCHANGED (0/1 exactly as v1.8/v2.0 — a change
        here would be a behaviour amendment needing higher authorisation);
        the --rerun summary line gains the executed=K/SKIPPED=J count so a
        consumer can see "vacuous pass" (0 OK + 0 MISMATCH + executed=0)
        without inventing an rc.
  CLOSED in v2.2 (inner-audit F-1, the one M-grade finding of the inner
    round — review-loop discipline: every fix ships with its permanent red
    pin, RR28/RR29): the flag-value bypass of the M3 operand fence.
    _operands_in_scope skipped EVERY '-'-leading token, so a path hidden
    INSIDE a flag — concatenated (`-f/PATH`, `-f~`, `-f../outside/x`) or
    equals-valued (`--file=PATH`, `--exclude-from=PATH`, `--files-from=PATH`) —
    walked past all three fence checks (absolute / ..-going / symlink) and
    the executor ran the whitelisted tool against a file OUTSIDE the
    document's directory, using it as a pattern table (measured on the
    inner round's live probes: `grep -c -f../outside_secret/candidate.txt
    x.txt` OK vs the same against y.txt cmd-failed — a 1-bit
    existence oracle for any path, sha12 echo confirming the value;
    `-f/etc/hosts` and `--file=/etc/hosts` the absolute twins, both OK).
    Fix is in the CONSERVATIVE direction — never execute by mistake: a
    '-'-leading token containing /, ~ or .. now refuses as SKIPPED-UNSAFE
    (flag-path-form), not executed, not echoed. Two verified no-change
    halves: (i) the SPACE-separated form (`-f /etc/hosts`) needed no new
    code — its value is a plain token the pre-existing /-leading non-flag
    rule already refused (live-verified: oob_doc/atkD SKIPPED before and
    after); (ii) pure path-free flags (`--version`, `-c`, `-race`-style
    short clusters, RR09/RR24 shapes) are untouched — all 101 pre-v2.2
    pins staying green IS the regression self-proof, plus the acceptance
    ④ key-diff. The over-refusal this opens (a legitimate flag value
    containing / ~ .., e.g. `--include='src/*.py'`) is recorded as the
    newly-opened safe-direction face below, per the boundary-record law.
  CLOSED in v2.3 (R2 fixR-A: outer-r2 M-1/M-2 + 镜二② 13-face register +
    镜三①-④ residue; the round's own lesson, "a pin must pin the reason"):
    (a) want_reason (the M-2 structural half): every RERUN_CASES tuple is
        now SIX fields with a third slot asserting the refusal LABEL of a
        SKIPPED detail ("(<reason>) …" prefix). 18 existing SKIP pins
        gained their reasons; the 13-member label set is derived from the
        source and census-enforced on AXIS3 — rename/delete any emission
        site ⇒ at least one red pin, named AXIS3. This closes the root
        cause 镜二②#5 blamed for path-disguise ("no reason-string hostage,
        no want ever checked a reason"): deleting the branch now emits
        not-whitelisted ≠ path-disguise and RR04d/RR13 go red.
    (b) the 13 no-pin faces absorbed (face# → holder, each mutation-checked
        out of tree before landing): #1 outside-quote markdown-unescape ⇒
        RR48 (M-1: the P4 identity mutant is no longer silent) + RR47 (the
        state-machine backslash-pair half; a backtick-escape outside quotes
        is BEHAVIOURALLY INVISIBLE — the raw backtick already trips the
        shell-metachar check before and after unescape — so it is 并入
        RR04e, recorded, not fake-pinned); #2 unbalanced-quote refusal ⇒
        RR32 (the face whose header attribution to RR14 was corrected
        above); #3 missing-required-flag ⇒ RR34; #4 _LONG_FLAG long twins
        ⇒ RR35 (verdict-stable BSD/GNU: reaches the executor ⇒ MISMATCH
        either way, while deleting the map ⇒ SKIP — flips under mutation
        on both platforms); #5 path-disguise ⇒ want_reason on RR04d/RR13;
        #6 empty-segment ⇒ RR33, exec-unavailable ⇒ RR46 (the bare-env
        option constructs the branch outer-r2 called unconstructible);
        #7 unclosed-fence extension ⇒ RR38 (the (start,i) pairing routes
        stay pinned by SELFTEST fence cases via _fence_at; the EXTEND line
        had no holder — now it does); #11 the rerun-side "#→" twin ⇒ RR37
        (asserts no-verdict AND no-violation: the "SAME rule as
        violations()" claim is now pinned in BOTH copies, m-14); #12 the
        _block_after stop branches (bare-# / CMD / arrow-join), the
        no-fence-no-medium rule and _split_inline's trailing-# cut ⇒
        RR39/RR40/RR41/RR42/RR43; #13 「（…）」-suffix cut and 「…」-stem
        prefix ⇒ RR44/RR45; #10 the fence-marker skip in violations() ⇒
        one new SELFTEST carrier (m-15). Faces #8 and #9 were NOT pinned
        in place — they were FIXED: see (d).
    (c) dead-code register (镜三①②), selftest count and key diff recorded
        before/after each deletion (all in the fix report): rerun_report()
        (zero callers — main() formats the verdict tuples itself) deleted;
        the shlex except-ValueError layer is replaced by an EXPLICIT
        parity refusal inside _split_segments (an odd trailing-backslash
        run ⇒ None ⇒ the SAME emitted unbalanced-quote) — outer-r2 called
        the layer unreachable; a command ending in one lone backslash says
        otherwise: rather than delete the fail-safe, the state machine now
        ABSORBS its only remaining input, so shlex has no rejection input
        left and the emitted verdict/label byte-face is unchanged where
        reachable.
    (d) M3 fence pre-checks pruned (镜三③, Simplicity): the /-prefix and
        ..-segment checks in _operands_in_scope were behaviour-redundant
        with the realpath containment (same verdict, same label — RR21/22
        now refuse at the realpath site, verified) and are deleted; the
        ~-prefix check STAYS — it is NOT redundant (argv exec never
        tilde-expands, so a planted file literally named ~ is a real
        read target) and is pinned by RR36, which is the proof of the
        asymmetry (deleting only the ~ branch flips RR36 alone; deleting
        the / branch flips nothing because containment catches it —
        redundancy is what the deletion was for).
  CLOSED in v2.5 (fix-25 round, outer-v24 F1–F9 minimal repairs — every item
    below was RED-proofed before landing; the "B-lite: retire the git
    execution face" route was REVOKED in-loop: it is a 主线 105 strategic
    call, and both strategic alternatives (i) refuse-on-exec-capable-config-key
    / (ii) disable the face stay REGISTERED PENDING, not silently adopted):
    (F5/B) the repo-config execution face that v2.4's env block CLAIMED closed
        ("no external diff/textconv, no prompts … must not re-spawn our
        sandbox escapees") was FALSE for the victim repo's OWN .git/config:
        log.showSignature=true + gpg.program=<evil> + a crafted gpgsig commit
        made the whitelisted POSITIVE shape `git log --oneline` re-spawn the
        attacker (outer q3d A: verdict OK, marker=True). Fixed minimally: the
        hardened prefix now carries "-c","log.showSignature=false" (the
        out-of-tree proof in run/gate-showsig-fix.py). The load-bearing half
        is the pin, not the prose: M9 had shown NO existing pin held the
        second layer, so RR69 poisons a hermetic repo the same way, asserts
        verdict OK AND the marker sentinel absent — delete the -c pair and
        RR69 goes red on a real observable effect, not on a string.
    (F7/M) the --no-ext-diff injection was a DEAD branch (argv spy: after the
        v2.4 prefix insert argv[2] is ALWAYS '-c', so the
        `argv[2] in ("log","show","diff")` test never fired — M2=0 FAIL, and
        81 §九 listed the flag as shipped content). The prefix and the
        post-sub flag now come from ONE helper (_git_harden), the diff-capable
        sub receives --no-ext-diff IMMEDIATELY AFTER the sub token (a position
        git actually parses), and the position is pinned structurally
        (ENV-harden-argv-log / ENV-harden-argv-revparse: mutating the insert
        index, dropping the flag, or adding it to a non-diff sub flips them).
    (F1/M) _flag_grammar is fail-CLOSED: a whitelisted tool/sub with no
        grammar table now refuses as "no-grammar-table" (the 15th refusal
        reason; AXIS3 member; RR70 holds its want_reason via the new
        no-table-member opt, which temporarily extends RERUN_READONLY exactly
        the way the outer's fail-open experiment did) and the ENV-grammar-
        invariant pin asserts every RERUN_READONLY member HAS a table — the
        v2.4 disease ("add a member, forget the table ⇒ 0 FAIL and zero
        constraint") now cannot pass green.
    (F2/M) the grammar tables became a CLOSED SET: census AXIS4(grammar)
        derives the 22 entries from the LIVE dicts, diffs them against the
        frozen _EXPECTED_GRAMMAR both ways (member count included — the N4-B
        lesson, fourth axis), then blanks each entry on its own table line and
        requires ≥1 pin flip. The coverage battery's 15 silent acceptance
        entries (real accept-face effect, zero pins — typo/delete shipped
        green while real docs would have flipped to refused) now each carry an
        OK positive pin, RR53–RR68.
    (F6/M) PATH is no longer inherited unchecked: the one variable the
        sanitized env passed through verbatim, including empty/relative
        components — an empty component means "search the CWD", and the CWD is
        the DOCUMENT's directory, so a planted ./git executed under the
        whitelist (outer q3d F6: value-drift line from the attacker's output).
        _run_cmd now filters components to absolute ones and executes only the
        resolution of that filtered PATH by _exe_search — a local execvp-style
        search (no hit ⇒ exec-unavailable SKIP). WHY not shutil.which, said
        out because it is a lesson not a footnote: which resolves a RELATIVE
        component against the GATE's cwd while the child resolves it against
        the DOCUMENT's — so the first version of this fix shipped a pin whose
        plant was invisible to the resolver and mutation ME stayed green on
        the exec side. Pinned by RR71 (PATH=".:<real>" + a planted ./wc that
        touches a marker ⇒ the REAL wc answers, marker absent; ME-unfilter-PATH
        now flips RR71 + ENV-path-clean) and ENV-path-clean (unit half).
    (F8/M) marker/leak evidence left /tmp: --selftest now runs the repo-root
        review_guard_probes.py (邢's verbatim probes, the file the mainline
        shipped as the consumer of this gate) as the PRB-* tier — accepted=
        False ∧ synthetic_marker_written=False ∧ read_outside_synthetic_file=
        False asserted in the permanent suite; a moved copy prints a VISIBLE
        ABSENT line (never silence) and still counts as the run's own record.
    (F9/minor) the v2.4 trio RENUMBERED — RR37-files0-from→RR50-files0-from,
        RR38-ext-diff-p→RR51-ext-diff-p, RR39-cluster-positive→
        RR52-cluster-positive: the shorthand "RR37-39" collided with the
        v2.3-era holders RR37-rerun-arrow-twin / RR38-unclosed-fence /
        RR39-block-stop-hash (full cids were unique; reviewers searching by
        shorthand read the wrong pin). Every bare RR37/RR38/RR39 mention in
        the v2.3-era text of this file means the OLD holders. Convention debt
        (numbering rules) stays 移交登记 4, for the next brief.
    (F3/minor) single-source cleanup: the `--pretty` special case inside
        _flag_grammar is DELETED — the table regex "--pretty.*" is now the one
        truth (they were the same rule written twice; M3 proved deleting
        either half flipped nothing — and the entry itself was listed NO EFFECT
        by the coverage battery until RR68 gave it a holder); `import re as _re`
        is gone (module-level re was already imported — the function-local
        import habit belongs to os/subprocess in this file, not to re).
  OPEN faces CREATED by v2.5 (third-face record — killed / newly opened /
    platform-scoped; all measured this round, none assumed):
    (1) KILLED on the DEFAULT face: none (key diff v2.4→v2.5 = 0, re-measured
        by running both gates over the corpus). On the --rerun face the
        executed SET is unchanged (20 executed rows, verdict lines identical —
        recount by rerunning both versions, never by editing this prose): what
        changed for the 2 executed git rows is only the hardened argv (one
        more -c pair, absolute tool path), never the verdict.
    (2) NEWLY OPENED, over-skip side ONLY: a tool that exists ONLY under a
        relative PATH component now SKIPS as exec-unavailable instead of
        executing — zero corpus carriers, RR71 pins the direction; and a
        whitelist member without a grammar table now refuses
        (no-grammar-table) where v2.4 would have executed it unconstrained —
        constructible only by editing the whitelist, which the invariant pin
        makes red anyway, so no real-doc form changed verdict.
    (3) `--` (end-of-options) STILL refuses as non-allowlist-flag for wc/grep/
        log. Evaluated this round against the coordinator's ruling (评估入表,
        当前语料零载体，登记即可): 32 constructed over-refusal forms, zero
        corpus carriers → deliberately NOT widened (adding it opens an
        execution face nobody pastes; the loop law is register, not gamble).
        A future doc that hits it must re-adjudicate HERE, at this line.
    (4) the repo-config exec set remains an OPEN SET of keys (fsmonitor,
        hooks, textconv, credential helpers, …): v2.5 blocks and pins the ONE
        constructible gpg face; faces probed inert this round stay inert by
        measurement, not by claim (core.pager without a tty, builtin-priority
        vs alias, --ext-diff refused by grammar). The (i)/(ii) strategy choice
        is 主线 105's; this file does not claim "no external execution" beyond
        what RR69/PRB/q3d-battery re-runs demonstrate.
    (5) PRB tier coupling: it locates the probes file as
        <gate>/../../review_guard_probes.py — correct for the repo layout
        (agent-festival/tools vs root), prints the visible ABSENT line for any
        other placement (out-of-tree mutant copies included, which is why the
        census mutation counts are NOT inflated by it).
    (6) BSD/GNU platform scope of the new positive pins: `wc --lines` is NOT a
        BSD option — RR53 asserts the platform-STABLE half only (the shape
        REACHES the executor ⇒ MISMATCH either way: BSD cmd-failed, GNU
        value-drift; same discipline as RR35); `grep --extended-regexp` and
        every git-family entry exist on both sides and pin OK. macOS ran every
        pin here; the Linux/GNU face is 105's to re-run.
  OPEN faces CREATED by v2.3 (third-face record — killed / newly opened /
    FP; all measured this round, none assumed):
    (1) KILLED: none on the DEFAULT face — snapshot key diff 0 and
        --rerun 68号 keeps executed=7/SKIPPED=0; what v2.3 killed are
        UNPINNED states, not verdicts (the 13 faces above).
    (2) AXIS3's own blind spots, stated AS blind spots (the lesson applies
        to the axis itself): the axis mutates LABELS, not branch semantics
        — a refactor that relocates a refuse while re-emitting the SAME
        string survives every mutation (the want_reason holder keeps
        passing), and per-SITE coverage inside one label is not
        census-provable (outside-docdir has 3 live sites; one AXIS3
        mutation renames all three at once — the manual per-site
        discriminators RR21/22/23/36 are only as strong as their shapes).
        A reason firing in NO case is UNPINNED (caught), but coverage
        means "every label has a holder", NOT "every path is walked". The
        singularity section's "reason is a closed set: a literal set" is
        true exactly at this granularity — recorded so no round over-reads
        the axis.
    (3) the (d) widening, honestly: an operand whose ..-loops resolve BACK
        inside the doc dir (a `sub/../a.txt`-shaped token) now EXECUTES
        where v2.2 SKIPPED it — confinement to in-tree reads is preserved
        (the M3 face-2a allowance). MEASURED zero delta: --rerun over the
        85-file snapshot domain gave identical verdict lines before/after
        (recount by rerunning both versions, never by editing this prose).
    (4) NEW FPs: NONE — no default-path pattern moved (key diff 0); every
        v2.3 pin asserts CURRENT behaviour, none changed it. RR36's ~-file
        and RR47's pipe-filename shapes are new SUITE members, not new
        refusals.
    (5) line-anchor/count governance (m-3/M-1/m-4/m-2): the header carries
        NO self-line-count and no bare line-number cross-references —
        entries are named, never numbered, because a drifting line anchor
        in a counting gate is the ㉜-family disease itself; every numeric
        self-claim (pin counts, key diffs, flip counts) is re-measured per
        round by running the tool, and numbers quoted in fix reports are
        run output, never copied forward.
  STILL OPEN (advisory, documented — the closed-set boundary record, both
    faces: killed FPs and newly-opened escapes) — the severity-count idiom
    (「0B+2M+8m」「B=1 M=2」) is OUTSIDE the counting domain by adjudication:
    its evidence is the blank-sub round report, not a command-reproducible
    count (rule-1's domain is command-derivable counts; severity counts in
    outbound docs ride rule-2/reviewer rerun — recorded exemption, not
    oversight; note 「M=2」 half-faces via TRIPLE, B/m postfix forms never);
    non-command FALSE-POSITIVE
    forms: pointer claims (「见 §X」 — evidence by reference is not seen),
    label forms (「N6 件」 — item labels), quote forms (transcribing another
    party's historical false claim — SINCE v2.0 this face has teeth for the
    Chinese side too: 「五处更正」 inside 「」 now FLAGS (CN-C1 pins the
    re-based expectation True; the 199-carrier 「…」 measurement is in the
    CREATED section) — "flag and adjudicate, never silently fix" is the
    68号「21 行」 precedent this form inherits, and 「21 行」-style quote
    carriers are explicitly NOT a fix target); closure words without
    digits (「零差异/全部一致/无差异」), English counts ("21 items"),
    N/M progress forms (no-space "已清偿 3/7 项" escapes — the numerator dies on unit adjacency (digit followed
    by /), the denominator on the lookbehind; the spaced "3 / 7 项" HAS
    its denominator caught), ordinal
    residuals with double/full-width spaces ("第  3 项" and the CN twin
    "第  三条" — the (?<!第 ) pair is single-space only), colon triples
    ("M:11"), command-prefix paste forms ("$ git …" / "- git …" not
    recognized → false positives; the rerun tier inherits the same blindness
    because it reuses CMD — a "$ " line is never extracted as an evidence
    command, so such lines stay in the default violation face and never
    reach the executor), and the presence-form limit: an unrelated nearby command (git status) satisfies the window; the unit
    table itself is a closed set — units outside it (e.g. 「N 批」「N 步」,
    and the v2.0 example 「三档」) escape by definition; extending it requires a selftest case per new unit
    (P-Ⅲ: a unit-set change would flip census 21 → 22 and break the pinned
    21-member acceptance, so 档/批/步 stay out and CN-C3 pins 三档 as False);
    the 万/千 numeral residuals (v2.0 digit class = 零〇一二三四五六七八九十百千两):
    「三万条」 and the mixed form 「20万条」 escape by design (1 real carrier
    measured in the domain: 67号:92 「五万」); 廿/卅/□ and full-width digits
    are not in the class; the 〇/零 guards stop WORD forms only — the
    closure-phrase forms 「零差异/全部一致」 stay open unchanged.
  OPEN faces CREATED by v1.3–v1.8 (the boundary record's third face — v1.8's
    unscoped 比-skip briefly let ANY unit+比 escape (「3 组比较」「7 条比值」)
    until iter-2 M-1 unit-scoped it in-version (zero real-doc escape
    carriers — closed in-version; the spaced 「类 比」 form is not skipped,
    zero carriers, known FP form; the 「N 类比」 REAL-count form (类比 as a
    bare compound count noun, the 12 测试 disease family) is also swallowed
    by the skip — zero real-doc carriers today, advisory record, known
    escape face; the skip's CHAR-level trigger (类+比) is undecidable against
    Chinese segmentation — a real 「N 类」 count followed by any 比-initial
    word (比较/比值/比重/比对) is also swallowed (「这 3 类比较重要」 → None):
    zero real-doc carriers (all 14 swallowed lines are the 0600 family —
    no-skip mutant vs v1.8 full-repo diff), the 比-initial word family
    adjudicated (类比=skip target; 比较/比值/比重/比对=real-count adjacency,
    recorded advisory — R78 M-1); v1.7's `.` also opened a DECIMAL-adjacent escape face
    (「均值 2.5 处」「平均 3.5 项」 — the fractional digit after . is blocked,
    where v1.6 caught the 「5 处」 part) — 2 real-doc carriers at MATCH
    granularity (52:549 「3.5 个」, proposal/03:66 「2.6 个」); at LINE
    granularity zero misses (both lines stay flagged via sibling matches —
    no silent leak); the 20 figure = flag-killed line count over the
    all-repo md scan domain (recount: rerun the gate with `.` removed from
    the class), structurally inseparable from the FP closure (same
    lookbehind char), recorded advisory);
    recorded, not hidden; the header's version domain must roll with every
    extension, ㉙ rolling rule) — the v1.6 bare-compound tightening:
    测试/函数/删除/新增/提交/新提交 entering the set newly flags legacy
    lines v1.2 passed (real-doc instances: 「2 新增」「5 新增」「10 测试」
    「12 测试」「3 提交」「46 提交」「7 函数」「1 删除」 across impl docs —
    quote/summary forms, some genuine catch candidates); the v1.3 unit-family
    tightening: 包/PASS entering
    the unit set newly flags legacy quote/summary lines that v1.2 passed
    (real-doc instances: 「21 包」×2 /「20 包」/「1 PASS」 in 60/64号 — quote
    and summary-position forms; some are genuine §五 rule-1 catch
    candidates); v1.3 also KILLED the 「第 4 件」 ordinal FP (the
    killed-FP face, recorded — same 第-lookbehind batch as the ordinal-noise
    closure above: same mechanism, same version, iter-4 M-2 fixed the
    mis-attribution); the SELF-DYED output-role escape: a real claim
    written as "# → …" inside a command-bearing fence is exempt
    (indistinguishable from a genuine pasted output; adversarial-only
    form); the bare-line tightening FP: a counting line WITHOUT a # prefix
    far from its fence's command now flags where v1.2 passed (±8 holds
    inside fences too — intended, recorded); the FENCE exemption is
    presence-form at fence granularity (ANY command in the fence
    satisfies it, related or not); nested four-backtick fences flip the
    pairing and can misflag legit outputs (zero usage in real docs);
    ASCII arrows ("# ->") are not exempted (zero usage).
  OPEN faces CREATED by v2.0 (third face, measured on the 85-file corpus
    snapshot domain, all numbers from this round's own runs — recount by
    rerunning the two-gate key diff, never by editing this prose):
    (1) CN TIGHTENING = +1500 newly flagged lines over the snapshot domain
        (379 → 1879 hits; lost=0 keys, so the change is monotone at line
        granularity). Composition: every gained claim literal contains a
        Chinese numeral (verified by key-diff census, 1500/1500); the volume
        is dominated by the numeral 一 and the classifier 个/次 forms —
        一+个 185 lines, 一+次 113, 两+个 112, 两+轮 81, 三+件 58 — and
        534/1500 gained literals start with 一, the Chinese indefinite-
        article reading of 「一个/一次」 ("a/one time") being the largest
        STRUCTURAL FP family this tier opens. It is NOT guarded: no decidable
        char-level discriminator separates 「对应一个需求」 (article) from
        「修复一次入口」 (count) — the same undecidability the v1.8 类+比
        record names — and an undecidable guess would be a silent-exemption
        (㉝④ class), so the family ships FLAGGED-for-human-look and the
        existing-doc hits stay register-only (§七 immunity). Quote forms
        inside 「」 gained 199 carriers on this face (CN05 re-based, above).
    (2) LITERAL LEFT-SHIFT on already-flagged lines: 53 carriers keep their
        file:line key and their flag but their quoted claim changes
        (minor-ledger:221 「 18 条」 → 「 十二轮」, 18-blank-r9:87 the TRIPLE
        fallback 「M=0」 → COUNTING 「 三条」) because the CN alternative can
        win the leftmost position. Consequence for consumers: the
        `count claim '…'` string is NOT a stable ledger key — key the audit
        on file:line, not on the literal (accepted consequence of closing
        the digit slot inside the SAME pattern; a separate CN regex would
        have broken the single-units-group invariant instead).
    (3) rerun over-skip face: the guard splits the raw command text on
        `&& | ; ||` BEFORE tokenizing, so a QUOTED `|` inside a legitimate
        read-only command (「`grep -cE '^\\*\\*(真裁|知悉)'`」, the 68号:136
        carrier form) classifies SKIPPED-UNSAFE and is never executed. The direction
        is safe (a paste that could have been verified is left unverified —
        the default verdict for its claim line is untouched, and SKIP is not
        an error), the cost is coverage; RR18/RR16 pin it so a future
        tokenizer that parses quotes first MUST flip a case and re-adjudicate
        here rather than silently widen the execution surface. → CLOSED in
        v2.1 by the quote-aware segmenter + escape normalization (M4 above);
        RR18 was flipped to OK (the mandated re-adjudication) and the
        execution surface widened ONLY for forms that were previously
        mis-SKIPPED, under the NEW operand fence (M3) — net narrower.
    (4) rerun cwd/anchor face: the cd segment is dropped and the tail runs
        in the DOCUMENT's directory (task-specified), so a paste taken under
        「cd <other-root> && …」 (64号:32 form) either fails or mismatches
        rather than being verified in place; git forms are root-insensitive
        (rev-parse/log), path-relative forms are not (wc -l testdata/…) —
        RR06a pins the accepted shape (cd . && read-only tail).
    (5) paste-equality tolerance face: comparison is whitespace-token
        prefix matching with 「（…）」-suffix and 「——」-tail cut and a
        「…」-stem prefix rule (the real-doc carrier forms are truncated shas
        and wc-with-filename lines) — a change confined to the TAIL of a
        pasted line beyond the expected tokens can be masked by design;
        RR02/RR08 pin the value-drift direction, the tail-mask itself is
        recorded (not guarded) because tightening it would reject 64号-style
        truncated pastes.
    (6) rerun is opt-in and rc-affecting: without --rerun nothing in the
        default path moved (byte-diff acceptance ③ is the pin); with
        --rerun, mismatches join rc=1 while SKIPPED lines never do.
  OPEN faces CREATED by v2.1 (the third face for this version — killed FPs,
    newly opened escapes, new FPs; all measured, none hidden):
    (1) M2 killed-FP face: every default-path key lost v2.0→v2.1 carries the
        个-unit immediately followed by [月日年点时分秒] (the duration class;
        census in dg-v21.txt, lost-outside-class=0 is acceptance ③'s pin).
        New FP of the fix: a REAL count whose 个 is followed by a class char
        is now skipped the same way (「两个时代的对比」 个+时, 「三个日历」 个+日)
        — char-level undecidable against segmentation, same class as the
        v1.8 类+比 record; zero carriers measured in the snapshot domain
        (recount by rerunning the gate with the guard removed, never by
        editing this prose). Spaced 「三个 月」 is NOT guarded (the guard is
        direct-adjacency, lookbehind fixed-width 1) — zero carriers.
    (2) M3 fence residual faces: (a) READING inside the doc directory stays
        reachable — the fence bounds WHERE operands resolve, not whether the
        whitelisted tools may read anything under the document's directory
        (a planted in-tree file is legitimate evidence by design); (b) the
        sha-prefix echo of drifted output leaks no content, but a rerun can
        CONFIRM a guessed low-entropy output (existence/known-value oracle
        survives as a weak channel; the strong leak — first-line content in
        stdout — is closed); (c) non-flag tokens that are not paths (a grep
        PATTERN) are path-checked too — an absolute-looking or ..-looking
        pattern (e.g. `grep -c /etc file.txt`) over-skips: safe direction,
        zero real-doc carriers; (d) escaped backticks inside a PROSE
        backtick span are cut by the span regex before normalization can
        see them (extraction ordering unchanged) — such lines stay in the
        default face, never reach the executor.
    (3) M4 face: the execution surface widened exactly for quoted-metachar
        forms (previously mis-SKIPPED); they now run under argv-direct exec,
        still whitelist-bounded, now also operand-fenced — no new shell
        reach (splitting on unquoted metachars is unchanged). Unterminated
        quotes still refuse as unbalanced-quote — behaviour TRUE (live probed), but the "(RR14 lineage)"
        attribution was FALSE (outer-r2 M-2: RR14 pins skip-precedence
        (multi-segment), never this refusal face — the unbalanced layer
        shipped untested for two generations; its first real holder is
        v2.3's RR32, asserted through want_reason). A `\"`→`"`
        normalization OUTSIDE quotes changes shell tokenization of that
        exact byte sequence — markdown intent (escaped display quote) is
        what shlex then sees as a real quote; recorded, zero carriers
        disagreeing.
    (4) N4 face: the frozen census expectations (21 units / 5 members / the
        named member lists) are a deliberate SECOND source of truth at the
        pin site — the P-Ⅰ mirror-drift disease is inverted here on
        purpose: a units-set or whitelist edit must touch the census
        expectation too or it goes RED (extension by accident becomes
        impossible to green silently).
  OPEN faces CREATED by v2.2 (the third-face record for this version —
    killed forms, newly opened over-skips, residuals; measured on the same
    85-file corpus snapshot domain this round, none hidden):
    (1) KILLED face: the concatenated / equals-value flag-path forms —
        the inner-audit oracle trio (oracle_hit / oracle_abs /
        oracle_host, each executed=1 under v2.1) flips to
        SKIPPED-UNSAFE (flag-path-form) with executed=0 under v2.2
        (out-of-selftest live re-run, transcripts in the fix report);
        RR28/RR29 keep the same boundary pinned in-tree and go red the
        moment the rule is deleted.
    (2) NEWLY OPENED face, over-skip direction ONLY (safe side): a
        legitimate flag or pattern VALUE containing / ~ .. (an
        --include='src/*.py' style flag, a range flag) now refuses
        WITHOUT executing — a paste that could have been verified stays
        unverified; SKIP is not an error and the default verdict is
        untouched (same family as the M3 face-2c non-flag-pattern
        over-skip, same measure-or-go-zero discipline: MEASURED ZERO
        carriers this round — the v2.1→v2.2 rerun-verdict diff over the
        85-file snapshot domain is 0 changed lines (222 verdict lines
        identical both versions) and the default-face key diff is 0
        (1845==1845); the only real flip is the out-of-tree oob_doc
        attack trio (executed→SKIPPED). Recount by rerunning both
        versions, never by editing this prose).
    (3) RESIDUALS 2a-2d UNCHANGED and standing as recorded under v2.1:
        (a) reads INSIDE the doc directory stay reachable (the fence
        bounds WHERE operands resolve, not what in-tree evidence may
        read); (b) the sha12 existence/low-entropy confirmation channel
        survives; (c) non-flag pattern operands stay path-checked; (d)
        escaped-backtick spans stay cut before the executor. None
        reopened, none widened — v2.2 only closes what the flag rule
        smuggled past the fence.
